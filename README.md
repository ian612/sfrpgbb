Extra special thanks to wildj79 (https://github.com/wildj79), original author of the Starfinder Foundry VTT System, and the rest of the Foundry development community, who have been helpful discussing things on the Discord channel whenever I've had issues.

Additional thanks to CÃ©dric Hauteville (https://www.youtube.com/user/LieutenantRazak), whose Foundry VTT system development videos where extremely helpful for me while I learned javascript, html, css, and the Foundry VTT ecosystem.
