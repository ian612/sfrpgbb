# Starfinder Beginner Box Rulesystem (sfrpgbb)
Foundry VTT System for the Starfinder Beginner Box Ruleset (https://github.com/ian612/sfrpgbb)

Written by Ian Bennett (ian612)


## About
This system implements the rules decribed in the Starfinder Beginner Box for Foundry VTT. Due to differences in game mechanics between Starfinder and its Beginner Box, this system is implemented separately from the full Starfinder game, which can be found [here](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sfrpg).

The Beginner Box allows players and GMs to get their feet wet in the Starfinder universe, and enables play from levels 1 to 4.

Player Characters and NPCs/Aliens/Enemies are defined as actors, while spells, NPC abilities, and all types of gear (weapons, armor, equipment, etc.) are implemented as items. Inventory and Spell management is done via dragging and dropping items onto character/NPC sheets. Compendiums of pregenerated characters, alien NPCs, and equipment are included in the system to reduce required prep time.

Some calculations are handled automatically (total weapon bonuses, armor class, spell DC, etc.). Roll automation has been added from version 1.2 and onward. Ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls can all be made by clicking the appropriate text on the character or npc sheet. Damage for weapons can likewise be rolled by clicking on its thumbnail picture on the character or npc sheet.

### Beginner Box Adventure Content
Please note that this game system implements rules and data compendiums only. It **DOES NOT** include the Beginner Box adventure, maps, or artwork due to licensing limitations.
